#
# Intended for normal development. Supports hot/live reloading.
# Note: If `package.json` dependencies or Dockerfile change, will need to add --build flag to
# docker-compose. Make sure to add an entry into your /etc/hosts file as
# `127.0.0.1 fakeservices.datajoint.io`. This serves as an alias for the domain to resolve
# locally. With this config and the configuration below in NGINX, you should be able to verify
# it is running properly by navigating in your browser to `https://fakeservices.datajoint.io`.
# If you don't update your hosts file, you will still have access at `https://localhost`
# however it should simply display 'Not secure' since the cert will be invalid.
# Additionally, there is now a local-only database + account for development and testing. To
# access it, connect using: database:local-db, user:root, password:labbook. Feel free to
# alter any part of it as it will be reset between docker-compose down/up commands.
